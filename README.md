# Realtime-Alzheimers-deisease-detection
üëÅÔ∏è Blink Detection, Gaze Tracking & Speech Recognition App

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive application that uses computer vision and speech recognition techniques to:
- Detect **blinks** and **track pupil size**
- Perform **gaze movement analysis**
- Assess **speech accuracy** from a given paragraph
  
#üöÄ Features

üîπ Blink Detection & Pupil Tracking
Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect blinks.

Tracks left and right iris radius in real-time.

Blinks are counted and analyzed over a 60-second session.

Option to capture frame snapshots.

Displays warning if blinks exceed a threshold‚Äîpotential Alzheimer's indicator.

üîπ Gaze Tracking
Monitors eye movement across the screen.

Calculates variation in gaze direction using facial landmarks.

Quantifies focus and attention level.

üîπ Speech Recognition
Displays a reference paragraph for the user to read.

Records and transcribes speech using Google Speech API.

Compares transcribed speech with reference text.

Calculates speech match accuracy percentage.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Library	Purpose

cd blink-gaze-speech-app

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run blink_gaze_speech_app.py


üì∏ Blink Detection Module Demo

Press "Capture Image" to take a snapshot of the current webcam feed.

Press "Reset Blink Count" to start blink counting again.

After 60 seconds, results will display whether blink frequency is within a healthy range.

üß† Cognitive Tests

Gaze Tracking: Click "Start Gaze Test" to track eye movement for 60 seconds.

Speech Recognition: Read the given paragraph aloud and press "Start Speech Test".

Results will show spoken text and match accuracy with the original paragraph.

üìà Result Interpretation

Test Component	Indicator

Blink Rate	>20 blinks ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Alzheimer sign

Pupil Size	Displayed in mm for analysis

Gaze Variation	Higher = poor focus (possible attention issues)

Speech Accuracy	Lower % = possible speech or memory difficulty
