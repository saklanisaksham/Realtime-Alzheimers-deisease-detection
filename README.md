# Realtime-Alzheimers-deisease-detection
üëÅÔ∏è Blink Detection, Gaze Tracking & Speech Recognition App

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive application that uses computer vision and speech recognition techniques to:
- Detect **blinks** and **track pupil size**
- Perform **gaze movement analysis**
- Assess **speech accuracy** from a given paragraph
  
#üöÄ Features

üîπ Blink Detection & Pupil Tracking
-- Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect blinks.
-- Tracks left and right iris radius in real-time.
-- Blinks are counted and analyzed over a 60-second session.
-- Option to capture frame snapshots.
-- Displays warning if blinks exceed a threshold‚Äîpotential Alzheimer's indicator.

üîπ Gaze Tracking
-- Monitors eye movement across the screen.
-- Calculates variation in gaze direction using facial landmarks.
-- Quantifies focus and attention level.

üîπ Speech Recognition
-- Displays a reference paragraph for the user to read.
-- Records and transcribes speech using Google Speech API.
-- Compares transcribed speech with reference text.
-- Calculates speech match accuracy percentage.

### üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saklanisaksham/Realtime-Alzheimers-deisease-detection.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Realtime-Alzheimers-deisease-detection

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run <filename>.py  # Replace <filename>.py with your actual script name

```

üì∏ Blink Detection Module Demo

- Press "Capture Image" to take a snapshot of the current webcam feed.
- Press "Reset Blink Count" to start blink counting again.
- After 60 seconds, results will display whether blink frequency is within a healthy range.

üß† Cognitive Tests

Gaze Tracking: 
- Click "Start Gaze Test" to track eye movement for 60 seconds.
- Speech Recognition: Read the given paragraph aloud and press "Start Speech Test".
- Results will show spoken text and match accuracy with the original paragraph. 

### üìà Result Interpretation

| Test Component   | Indicator                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Blink Rate**   | >20 blinks ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible Alzheimer sign           |
| **Pupil Size**   | Displayed in mm for analysis                      |
| **Gaze Variation**| Higher = poor focus (possible attention issues)  |
| **Speech Accuracy**| Lower % = possible speech or memory difficulty  |
